# Network Vision
This directory contains the scripts used to run grip pipelines exported to python.  

To run, use the following command:
`python3 network_vision.py`

These files can be run on a Raspberry Pi with the Official 2019 FRC Image: https://github.com/wpilibsuite/FRCVision-pi-gen/releases

In order to run on this image, remove the camera and disable the client network tables on the 'Vision Settings' tab on the Pi's web server.
